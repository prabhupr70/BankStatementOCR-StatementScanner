Statement Scanner -  Goal is to build a bank statement (AI Studio Project)

The goal is to build a bank statement OCR system. It takes images and PDF files as input and extracts the information. The extracted data is then put into a CSV format. The CSV file contains:
- Transaction date
- Transaction title or description
- The amount
- Any notes about the transactions




Build a bank statement OCR tool:
INPUT: Upload PDF/image bank statement
OUTPUT: CSV table with these columns:
| Date | Description | Amount | Category | Notes | 

REQUIREMENTS:
Use Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision to extract ALL transactions
Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
Amount: positive for deposits, negative for expenses
Category: auto-detect (groceries, dining, transport, salary, bills, etc.)
Handle multiple-page PDFs
Skip header, totals, non-transaction rows
Output clean csv ready to copy-paste into Google sheets

Provide extraction code with clear instructions


For the extracted transaction table, I want to show exactly how much is being spent in this transaction or this transaction table. 
I want to be able to see how many records we have for all the transactions, as well as the total spending and the total income from this statement.
Create a section that shows this based on the calculation that we have instead of a table.


When I copy to the CSV using the "copy to CSV" button, here is what the format looks like after I paste it. 
Can you be able to format the CSV format here to make it fit for all the columns and all the cells inside of our Google Sheets?


Please add functionality that allows users to upload multiple PDF or PNG files, or multiple image files of PDF files to analyze the entire bank statements.



I want to implement a feature where it can show the progress of file processing. Specifically, I want to display:
- The total number of files being loaded.
- The number of files currently pending.
- The number of files that have been completed.
This would be more informative than just showing a spinning icon, which might lead users to believe the system is stalled or in a non- responsive state. 
This enhanced visibility would allow users to see precisely how many files have been processed and which ones are still waiting to be processed.


Note: This was NOT implemented
==============================
Implement more robust error handling for file conversion in 'utils/fileUtils.ts'. 
Currently, if a single PDF page fails to render or convert, it might cause the entire process to halt or lead to unexpected results. 
Add specific try-catch blocks around the page rendering and canvas operations within 'pdfToImageParts'. 
If an error occurs for a specific page, log a warning for that page but allow the conversion of other pages to proceed. 
Update 'App.tsx' to provide more granular feedback to the user if some files or pages within a file could not be processed.
